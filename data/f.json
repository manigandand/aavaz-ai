Recently they changed it to subscription model where you need to buy a free delivery subscription otherwise for each order you have to pay RS 20. Here is the interesting part, if you are not subscribed to \"free delivery\", they will deliberately miss 1 or 2 items from your orders, so that you will order again by paying extra RS 20.

Even better than big basket. However, recently they have started charging huge delivery fees - 2 rs per litre of milk. Also each egg / veg / fruit delivery is now charged at 20 rs per delivery. Frankly, I think, it is a strategy to reduce customer base before closing shop. I have shifted to bigbasket. May come back once delivery chrgs revert",

I cancelled all my active subscriptions. Now lets see whether Ill get my refund or not. There is hardly any available items on their app, whatever you choose, it doesnt get delivered the next day. You are literally paying Supr Daily to rip yourself. Getting through the customer care is yet another challenge. There is no coordination between the team and the delivery partners. It is so disheartening to see the attitude of these apps who would stop at nothing to make the lives of the customers miserable.

But recently they have introduced delivery fees and Supr Access which is looting people. Having started as free delivery app now they are charging very high rates for delivery of any item. Edit: I personally feel this delivery fees is to promote your Supr Access program. You can check your reviews on how many people are not happy with your delivery fees.",
